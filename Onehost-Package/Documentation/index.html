![install plugins](images/install-plugins.png)


Import demo content
-------------------

If you are new to WordPress and have problems with setting up the theme you might want to import the demo content file that comes with the theme. The following actions will import some dummy posts and pages from the live preview:

- Go to `Tools > Import`
- Select **WordPress** from the list
- If you haven't installed the **WordPress import plugin**, a popup window will appears and ask you to install it. Just click **Install Now**. When the installation progress is completed, click **Activate Plugin & Run Importer**. If you have installed this plugin, skip to next step.
- Click **Browse** and select `sample-content.xml` file from the download package
- Click **Upload file and import**
- When you are asked to import author, you can create new author or import to existing author. You also should check the checkbox **Download and import file attachments**.

![import](images/import-data.png)

![install plugin importer](images/install-plugin-importer.png)

![select demo content](images/select-import-data.png)

After completing all above steps, go to `Posts`, `Pages`, `Portfolios`, `Team` to see imported data.



Setup homepage and blog page
-------------------------------------

After install demo content, you'll see a page 8 Homepage pages, as you see on our demo. You can use one of theme as the homepage of the website. To set it as homepage, please go to `Settings \ Reading`, under **Front page displays**, please chose **A static page (select below)** and select a homepage version (eg: Homepage Slider Dark) for **Front page** and select **Blog** page for **Posts page**.

![setup front page](images/setup-front-page.png)



Setup Menu
--------------

Although the theme is working now and it shows menu, but because we haven't created a menu for primary location, the theme will display all pages by default. But displaying pages instead of one page sections is a bad idea, because Onehost is one page theme.




###Edit imported menu (recommend)

When you import demo data, WordPress automatically create a menu for you, named `**One Page Menu**.

- Go to `Appearance > Menus`
- Select **One Page Menu** and click **Select** button to edit it.
- Select each menu item to edit, change the URL attribute to correct URL. With menu items for One Page, please input in format: `http://yoursite.com/#section-id`
- Scroll to bottom of page and check **Primary Menu** for **_Theme location_**
- Click **Save Menu**


###Create New Menu

Following these steps to create a menu:

- Go to `Appearance > Menus`
- Click the **create a new menu** link to create new menu.
- For normal menu item: Select items from the left meta boxes and click **Add to Menu**
- For menu items that you want to link to sections in the One Page: use Link meta box from the left, and input the URL in format: `http://yoursite.com/#section-id`, with `yoursite.com` is the you website's domain, and `#section-id` is the ID of section you wish to link to. (We will talk about how to set up ID for a section bellow).
- On the right, feel free to drag and drop menu items to organize them
- When you're done moving menu items, check **Primary Menu** for **Theme locations** at the bottom of the page
- Click **Save Menu**

![edit menu](images/edit-menu.png)

Create Your One Page
====================

Onehost uses page template and meta box to create onepage page, so the first step is just creating a page using `One Page` template (or you can edit exists page that has been imported via sample content file).

![select-page-template](images/page-template.png)

Onehost theme comes with Visual Composer plugin. This plugin allows you to forget about shortcodes and create most complex layouts within minutes without writing a single line of code!

###Visual Composer Basics

It has very simple and intuitive interface, but before getting started, you may find it useful to get accustomed with its documentation:

[Visual Composer Documentation](https://wpbakery.atlassian.net/wiki/display/VC/Visual+Composer+Pagebuilder+for+WordPress?title=Visual_Composer)

In Onehost theme, we also create some new Elements and add some new parameters to exists elements of Visual Composer. It will help you a lot to build your One Page easier. Following we will go through some popular elements of Visual Composer and all of new elements that Onehost theme brings to you.

------------------------------


Post Format
===========

[Post Formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) is theme feature which is a piece of meta information that can be used by a theme to customize its presentation of a post.

In short, with a theme that supports Post Formats, a blogger can change how each post looks by choosing a Post Format from a radio-button list.

Onehost theme supports the following post formats:

- `gallery` - A gallery of images, which will be displayed in a responsive image slider, powered by Flexslider.
- `link` - A link to another site.
- `image` - A single image, which will be shown above post title.
- `quote` - A quotation.
- `video` - A single video, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed above post title.
- `audio` - An audio file, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed using a powerful HTML5 audio player provided by Wordpress as default player.

Using post format in Onehost lets you differentiate post from each other and make the blog page / single page looks more beautiful.

[Go to blog page](http://demo.themealien.com/onehost/blog/) to see how post formats look.




When you edit a post, select a format you want to apply to that post on the **Format** meta box on the right:

![formats](images/post-format-box.png)

When you choose a format, a corresponding meta box will appear **below** the content editor, here's the list of them:

![formats](images/post-formats.png)

All you need to do is just enter **all** information in the fields in these meta boxes. This information will be used to decorate the post. For example: gallery post format will uses uploaded images to show a slider above post title, a video post will display a video player above post title, etc.

This will make sure everything is right there when you need it. But what are portfolio categories? Let's take a look at the following example. Imagine you are a photographer and you have a wide range of images you like to show to the crowd. Inside your portfolio you have landscape and portrait images, than these both would be exactly your categories. Categories are mainly used for filtering your portfolio items later on.

------------------------------


Translation
=========

###Tell WordPress which language file to use.

If you don’t use WordPress in your native language so far, you have to tell WordPress which language to use to activate the theme translation.

You can do this by editing the wp-config.php file (the file is located in the main directory of your WordPress files) and defining the WPLANG constant. You have to set your language code there, for example fr_FR for French translation.

ust add the line below to your wp-config.php or change it if it already exists:

`define ('WPLANG', 'fr_FR');`


###First Method: Using Codestyling Plugin

The easiest way to translate your theme locally is by using the [Codestyling Localization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/) plugin. After you have installed and activated the plugin, simply go to `Tools > Localization` (shown in your language) and translate the theme from your WordPress backend following the [plugin instructions](http://www.code-styling.de/english/development/wordpress-plugin-codestyling-localization-en)

###Second Mothod: Using Poedit

Poedit is a common program which you can use to translate the theme. It’s available for free on [poedit.net](http://www.poedit.net/).

After you have installed Poedit, you can open it and select `File > New Catalog from POT file`. Then select the .pot file from the theme you wish to translate which you can find in the `/lang/` folder of theme.

Then go through every line of text and translate it to your native language. Afterwards you can save the catalog with your language code (for example `es_ES.po`). Normally Poedit automatically creates the .mo file and saves it, too.

The last step you have to do is to upload your created language files to the language folder of your theme using FTP.


------------------------------


Child Theme
===========

Fastlat is fully child theme compatible. We have attached a basic child theme to the download package which contains the minimum of required files. If you are planing any code customisations we highly recommend to do this inside the child theme! Learn more about child themes [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)
